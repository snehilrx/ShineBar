    <string name="quote">“Don\'t just say you have read books. Show that through them you have learned to think better, to be a more discriminating and reflective person. Books are the training weights of the mind. They are very helpful, but it would be a bad mistake to suppose that one has made progress simply by having internalized their contents.”\n ― Epictetus, The Art of Living: The Classical Manual on Virtue, Happiness and Effectiveness</string>
